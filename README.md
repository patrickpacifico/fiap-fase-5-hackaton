# FIAP Fase 5 Hackaton

MVP: threat modeling with AI using STRIDE from architecture diagrams.

## Objective
- Detect components in architecture diagrams (users, servers, databases, APIs, gateways, etc.)
- Map components to STRIDE threats
- Generate a report with threats and countermeasures

## Scope (MVP)
1. Computer vision model to detect components in diagrams
2. Rule-based STRIDE mapping by component type
3. Auto-generated report (Markdown/PDF)

## Repo structure
- notebooks/  Colab notebooks
- data/       datasets (ignored by git)
- reports/    generated reports
- src/        helper scripts

## How to run (Colab)
Open the notebook in `notebooks/01_mvp_stride_threat_modeling.ipynb`.

## Deliverables
- Documentation of the flow
- Video up to 15 minutes explaining the solution
- GitHub repository link
